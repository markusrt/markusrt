# Inner Source - Collaborating on code inside the enterprise

## Slide 1: Introduction​

Inner source is a software development methodology
that adapts the principles and practices of open source
software development to create more collaborative, innovative,
and efficient software development within a company.​

As more companies are turning to open source software,
inner source is becoming an increasingly important
way for them to tap into the benefits of open source
development while still maintaining control over the
direction and use of their software.​

## Slide 2: What is inner source?​

Inner source refers to the application of open source principles
and practices within a company, rather than in a public open source community.​

Inner source is different from traditional software development
in that it emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-building.​

Examples of companies that have successfully implemented inner source
include Cisco, Google, and Intel.​

## Slide 3: Benefits of inner source​

Inner source can lead to increased collaboration between
teams and departments, which can result in faster
innovation and improved code quality.​

By opening up internal code to a wider group of developers,
inner source can also make more efficient use of resources,
as developers can build on existing code
rather than starting from scratch.​

Inner source can also help to build a culture of learning and
experimentation, leading to a more engaged and motivated workforce.​

## Slide 4: How to implement inner source​

To implement inner source, organizations should start by building a
community of developers who are interested in collaborating and sharing
knowledge.​

Setting up clear guidelines and processes for inner source development,
such as code review, testing, and documentation, can help to ensure that
the code is of high quality and can be easily understood and maintained.​

Providing training and support for inner source development, including
training on open source best practices and tools, can help to ensure
that developers have the skills and resources they need to contribute
effectively.​

## Slide 5: Conclusion​

Inner source is a powerful way for companies to tap into the
benefits of open source development while still maintaining
control over the direction and use of their software.​

By increasing collaboration, speeding innovation, and improving
code quality, inner source can lead to more efficient and effective
use of resources and a more engaged workforce.​
