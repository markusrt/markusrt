<!-- 
Welcome to this short introduction on inner source.
In case you are wondering about the ugly box of unformated
text right on this otherwise shiny title page ...
True to the motto of this presentation. I could not resist to
create it completely using source code. It is written in Markdown
and built using Marp, the Markdown presentation ecosystem.
Feel free to fix any typos via pull requests on GitHub later ;-)
 
So, what is inner source?

Inner source is a methodology that adapts the principles and practices
of open source software development to create a more collaborative,
innovative, and efficient working mode within a company.​

As more companies are turning to open source software,
inner source is becoming an increasingly important
way for them to tap into the benefits of open source
development while still maintaining control over the
direction and use of their software.​

However inner source does not need to stop at the software
level. There are many processes in an enterprise which would
benefit from a company-wide shared collarboration model.

Examples of non-code resources can include:
- Job descriptions for hiring
- Question catalogues for job interviews
- Standard operation procedures like employee onboarding
- Marketing texts and product descriptions
- Processes and workflows

# What is InnerSource?​

- Definition​
- Difference from traditional development​
- Widely adopted in industry
  - Microsoft
  - Google
  - Intel
  - ... [find some stories here](https://innersourcecommons.org/stories/)

<!--
Although there a various areas where inner source could be applied
the remainder of this talk will focus on software source code as
the most natural inhabitant of an inner source repository.

As already mentioned,
Inner source refers to the application of open source principles
and practices within a company, rather than in a public open source community.​

Inner source is different from traditional software development
in that it emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-building.
So instead of hiding code in individual teams' repositories it
is visible throughout the complete company.
​
When embarking the inner source journey in your enterprise,
you can gladly rely on good experience from others who went first.
Examples of companies that have successfully implemented inner source
include Microsoft, Google, Intel, and many others.

Many of the big companies like Microsoft have by now also embraced open source software development. This is a natural evolution following the adoption of inner source.

# What are the benefits of InnerSource​?

- Increased collaboration
- Faster innovation
- Fosters transparency across teams​
- Enhanced developer productivity​
- Code and knowledge sharing​
- Improved code quality​

<!--
There are numerous benefits of InnerSource:

It can lead to increased collaboration between
teams and departments, which can result in faster
innovation and improved code quality.​

Additionally, innovation is made transparent and is
encouraging others to, for example, join forces on
similar ideas instead of all starting from scratch.

By opening internal code to a wider group of developers,
inner source can also make more efficient use of resources,
as developers can build on existing sources on all aspects.

How many tools exists three or four times in your company
just because the work is not known to others?

Inner source can also help to build a culture of learning and
experimentation, leading to a more engaged and motivated workforce.​

# How can you implement InnerSource​?

- Promote the idea with your peers
- Build a community​
- Avoid common pitfalls by [learning from others](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/)
- Create guidelines and lightweight processes​
- Provide training and support​
- Start with first sprout projects

<!--
The first step to implement inner source in your company
is to promote the idea with your peers.

I am very happy, that you, my peers, joined to this event!
The first step is already done!

Following that, organizations should start by building a
community of developers who are interested in collaborating and sharing
knowledge.​

The community does not need to start from scratch. There
are many open source communities providing material on inner source.
The biggest one might be innersourcecommons.org. This site provides
great learning paths to get started.

Setting up clear guidelines and lightweight processes for inner source 
development, such as code review, testing, and documentation, can help to ensure that the code is of high quality and can be easily understood and maintained.​

Providing training and support for inner source development, including
training on open source best practices and tools, ensures
that developers have the skills and resources they need to contribute
effectively.​

# Conclusion

> Inner source is a powerful way for companies to tap into the benefits of open source development while still maintaining  control over the direction and use of their software.​

<!--
Inner source is a powerful way for companies to tap into the
benefits of open source development while still maintaining
control over the direction and use of their software.​

By increasing collaboration, speeding innovation, and improving
code quality, inner source can lead to more efficient and effective
use of resources and a more engaged workforce.​

Please follow these links to find additional, openly available
information on getting you started with inner source.

In fact, inner source is less about technicalities but way more
about building the culture where everybody feels save to openly
collaborate on their work.
